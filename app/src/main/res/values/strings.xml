        <b>Fact # 1</b>\t\tAll women are at risk. Approximately 70 precent of breast cancers occur in women with none of the known risk factors.\n\n

<b>Fact # 2</b>\t\tOnly about 5 percent of breast cancers are inherited. About 80 percent of women diagnosed with breast cancer will be the first to be victims in their families.\n\n

<b>Fact # 3</b>\t\tEarly detection does NOT prevent breast cancer. Avoiding and elimating known causes will prevent breast cancer!\n\n

<b>Fact # 4</b>\t\tMammography fails to detect as much as 20 percent of all breast cancer  and as much as 40 percent in women under the age of 50.\n\n

<b>Fact # 5</b>\t\tOne out of four who are diagnosed with breast cancer die within the first five years. No less than 40 percent die within ten years.\n\n

<b>Fact # 6</b>\t\tRisk factors are not necessarily causes of breast cancer. Enough evidence exist linking environmental pollution and contamination to cause breast cancer.\n\n

<b>Fact # 7</b>\t\tThe global incidence of breast cancer has tremendously risen by 256 percent the past 30 years with Southeast Asia increasing by 479 percent!   And the supposed authorities and experts that should know, dont know why.\n\n

<b>Fact # 8</b>\t\tBreast cancer is the leading killer of women ages 35 to 54 worldwide. More than a million women develop breast cancer without knowing it and almost 500,000 die from it every year.\n\n

<b>Fact # 9</b>\t\t1 out of 13 Filipno women will develop breast cancer in her lifetime. The province of Pampanga has the highest incidence rate in the entire country.\n\n

<b>Fact # 10</b>\t\tThe Philippines has the highest incidence rate of breast cancer in Asia and registered the highest increase of 589 percent among 187 countries over a 30 year period from 1980 to 2010.</string>


    <string name="wbc"><font size = "20"><b>What is Breast Cancer?</b></font>\n\n\t\tCancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control. Cells in nearly any part of the body can become cancer, and can spread to other areas of the body.\n\n\t\tBreast cancer is a malignant tumor that starts in the cells of the breast. A malignant tumor is a group of cancer cells that can grow into (invade) surrounding tissues or spread (metastasize) to distant areas of the body. The disease occurs almost entirely in women, but men can get it, too.\n\n</string>


    <string name="nb">"<font size = "20"><b>The Normal Breast</b></font>\n\nTo understand breast cancer, it helps to have some basic knowledge about the normal structure of the breasts, shown in the diagram below.\n\nThe female breast is made up mainly of lobules (milk-producing glands), ducts (tiny tubes that carry the milk from the lobules to the nipple), and stroma (fatty tissue and connective tissue surrounding the ducts and lobules, blood vessels, and lymphatic vessels).</string>
    \n\nMost breast cancers begin in the cells that line the ducts (ductal cancers). Some begin in the cells that line the lobules (lobular cancers), while a small number start in other tissues.\n\n


    <string name="ls"><font size = "20"><b>The Lymphatic System of the Breast</b></font>\n\nThe lymph system is important to understand because it is one way breast cancers can spread. This system has several parts.\n\nLymph nodes are small, bean-shaped collections of immune system cells (cells that are important in fighting infections) that are connected by lymphatic vessels. Lymphatic vessels are like small veins, except that they carry a clear fluid called lymph (instead of blood) away from the breast. Lymph contains tissue fluid and waste products, as well as immune system cells. Breast cancer cells can enter lymphatic vessels and begin to grow in lymph nodes.\n\nMost lymphatic vessels in the breast connect to lymph nodes under the arm (axillary nodes). Some lymphatic vessels connect to lymph nodes inside the chest (internal mammary nodes) and either above or below the collarbone (supraclavicular or infraclavicular nodes).\n\n</string>
    <string name="othertext">"If the cancer cells have spread to lymph nodes, there is a higher chance that the cells could have also gotten into the bloodstream and spread (metastasized) to other sites in the body. The more lymph nodes with breast cancer cells, the more likely it is that the cancer may be found in other organs as well. Because of this, finding cancer in one or more lymph nodes often affects the treatment plan. Still, not all women with cancer cells in their lymph nodes develop metastases, and some women can have no cancer cells in their lymph nodes and later develop metastases.\n\n


   <font size = "20"><b>Benign Breast Lumps</b></font>\n\nMost breast lumps are not cancerous (benign). Still, some may need to be biopsied (sampled and viewed under a microscope) to prove they are not cancer.


    \n\n<font size = "20"><b>Fibrosis and Cysts</b></font>\n\nMost lumps turn out to be caused by fibrosis and/or cysts, benign changes in the breast tissue that happen in many women at some time in their lives. (This is sometimes called fibrocystic changes and used to be called fibrocystic disease.) Fibrosis is the formation of scar-like (fibrous) tissue, and cysts are fluid-filled sacs. These conditions are most often diagnosed by a doctor based on symptoms, such as breast lumps, swelling, and tenderness or pain. These symptoms tend to be worse just before a womans menstrual period is about to begin. Her breasts may feel lumpy and, sometimes, she may notice a clear or slightly cloudy nipple discharge.


    \n\n<font size = "20"><b>Fibroadenomas and Intraductal Papillomas</b></font>\n\nBenign breast tumors such as fibroadenomas or intraductal papillomas are abnormal growths, but they are not cancerous and do not spread outside the breast to other organs. They are not life threatening.\n\nStill, some benign breast conditions are important because women with these conditions have a higher risk of developing breast cancer.</string>

    <string name="bernardita">Bernardita G. De Jesus -\nhormonal reproductive concerns\n\n\t
Born 07 October 1947 in Malabon M.M., Bernie’s menarche was at age 13. With an MBA degree and her last work as Operations Head of a computer data center, she opted for early retirement. She first gave birth at age 26 and less than a year later gave birth to her second child. This prompted her to take pills continuously for the next 6 years. But when she stopped because she wanted to have a 3rd child, she experienced tremendous reproductive problems in the next seven years: prolonged bleeding upon menstruation; several blighted ovum, five D and C’s and a miscarriage in1987 before she had a successful pregnancy at age 39 and gave birth in 1988. Sadly, her infant daughter died 18 months later. She opted for a detoxification to prevent affliction with breast cancer.</string>
    <string name="rosalisa">Rosalisa K. Alindahao -\nDiagnosed at age 42\n\n\t
Born on 14 December 1961 in Paco, Manila, her menarche was at age 12. At age 4, she suffered from asthma and received continuous medications. With an M.S. Degree in Economics, Shalee has been in the banking industry ever since. She started taking birth control pills intermittently at age 27 over a 10-year period.  She gave birth by cesarean section to all of her four children at ages 29, 30, 37 and 39. At the onset of her 2nd pregnancy, she experienced gestational diabetes. The longest breastfed was her 3rd child for a period of six months and the shortest was her eldest at only two weeks. Her first born died at an early age and deeply depressed her for a long period.  Four months before her 43rd birthday, she felt a lump in her right breast. A clinical breast exam was said to be benign but a mammogram and ultrasound done were suspicious for malignancy. A biopsy was then done and malignancy was confirmed. A mastectomy was promptly performed two weeks later and diagnosed with Stage 2A breast cancer with none of 13 lymph nodes recovered found positive. Two months later, she was told that she had brain metastasis. Alarmed and confused, she held off chemotherapy and sought other options. A thermal imaging done showed a severely abnormal pattern on her right post- mastectomy site. Shalee has since been pursuing non-toxic and non-invasive measures in confronting breast cancer. Shalee was a participant of Project BRCA 7 on October 2004. </string>
    <string name="ma_cristina">Ma. Cristina Latosa Bonina -\nDiagnosed at age 39\n\n\t
Born 04 February 1970 in Tatay, Rizal, her menarche was at the late age of 17. Her elementary and secondary years were in Lucena City while she took college in Puerto Princessa City. At age 26, she entered the Order of the Missionaries of the Holy Spirit in Bataan. She first noticed a small lump in her left breast at age 29 but was told by her superiors not to mind it. For the next ten years, the lump persisted and grew until it became itchy and when she scratched it, a wound resulted with a foul smell. Only then did her superiors have her seek medical consultation but Sister Cristina opted to pursue a non-toxic and non-invasive regimen as recommended by a friend-nun of hers who has been living with breast cancer for ten years without having undergone conventional medical treatments. Sister Cristina’s BC risk exposures were most likely her late menarche; irregular menstruation when she entered the convent due to manual laundry with intensive use of chlorox; her diet of donated canned goods and instant noodle and drinking the ground water from an area of large mango orchards regularly sprayed with chemicals. </string>
    <string name="marcelina">Marcelina S. Coloma –\nDiagnosed at age 44\n\n\t
        Born on 30 October 1957 in Loay, Bohol, her menarche was at age 13. A practicing optometrist, she was prescribed Clomid  in her desire to bear child. At age 42, she gave birth to her only child by cesarean section. Twenty months later, she felt a lump in her left breast. The result of a biopsy done was mucinous carcinoma. Two weeks later, she was rushed by her doctor for a mastectomy without discussing her biopsy result. She insisted to have it read first but her doctor said it could wait. After the operation, she was wondering why her doctor didn’t give much concern about the result. Unsatisfied with no explanations given her, she did her own research and learned that her lump was of the benign type and a simple lumpectomy could have been done. Three months later. she underwent a thermal imaging, which showed a severely abnormal pattern on her left post-mastectomy site. A repeat thermal imaging done a year later showed a persistent severely abnormal pattern. A third thermal imaging done another year later still showed the same findings. </string>

    <string name="annaliza">Annaliza Vibal-Alviar\n(20 May 1966 – 07 March 2009)\n\n\t
Diagnosed at age 41 and died 15 months later. A native of Los Banos, Laguna, her menarche was a age 12. Her entire family had long been drinking ground water (highly suspected of contamination due to their proximity to Laguna de Bay and from the rust of their pump) and only when the town water system was installed in the late ‘80s did they shift to chlorinated tap water. Anna was an elementary school teacher for a total of16 years and experienced required annual chest X-ray when she became a public school teacher at age 30.  She got pregnant a year later but sadly experienced a 2-month term miscarriage and never got pregnant since and failed to undergo a D and C. At age 38, during her annual medical examination required of all public school teachers, she had five chest X-rays within one week because the technician had to keep repeating the procedure until an acceptable X-ray was done.  Two years later, she noticed a lump and the result of a biopsy performed was positive. From that time onwards, she underwent numerous scans, x-rays and other diagnostic procedures because of her health card. However, most tests showed negative results and she was placed under observation and monitoring until the lump got bigger and bigger. Frustrated especially that her card limit had been reached, Anna decided not to go back to her doctor and opted for a non-toxic and non-invasive approach to her dilemma.       </string>

Diagnosed at age 53 and died 2 years later. A native of Bilar, Bohol, her menarche was at age13. However, Babes experienced menstruation only once a year, every November. Always, two months prior, she would experience cramps on her right leg and pain on her right abdominal side. At age 16, she was made to take hormonal pills to regulate her cycle but without the knowledge of her physician and parents, took it only for two months because she did not want to experience the monthly difficulties she saw from other girls. Upon finishing her B.S. degree in Pharmacy, she operated a drugstore. About a year after her marriage at age 27, she gave birth to her first child but was only able to breast feed for a month. She was then only able to menstruate for 3 consecutive months and after which, was back to an annual menstruation until she became pregnant with her 2nd child two years later. Thereafter, her menstruation was again once a year until age 42 when it became monthly. Five years later, it became 4 times a year and 3 years later, twice a year. Her 2nd eldest sister was diagnosed at age 45 with breast cancer 20 years after relocating to Chicago and who died a year after surgery and chemotherapy. Her 5th elder sister was diagnosed at age 51 with breast cancer after 20 years after relocating to New Jersey. Both worked in hospitals, the former as a medical technologist and the latter, as a graveyard nurse. At age 52, Babes felt a lump in her right breast but it was only after 7 months that she had a mammogram done, which was suspicious for malignancy and a biopsy confirmed ductal carcinoma. Grade 1. She was then made to undergo a chest x-ray and CT-Scan in preparation for breast surgery and chemotherapy. It was this point that she started searching for an alternative approach, not wanting to experience the toxic and invasive procedures done on her sisters and others she saw. She underwent a thermal imaging, which showed an abnormal pattern on her right breast. With the full support of her husband and children, Babes embarked on a non-conventional and non-traditional regimen to confront her condition.</string>

    <string name="symptoms">A symptom is only felt by the patient, and is described to the doctor or nurse, such as a headache or pain. A sign is something the patient and others can detect, for example, a rash or swelling.

The first symptoms of breast cancer are usually an area of thickened tissue in the womans breast, or a lump. The majority of lumps are not cancerous; however, women should get them checked by a health care professional.

\n\n<b>Women who detect any of the following signs or symptoms should tell their doctor (NHS, UK):</b>

\n\n * A lump in a breast
\n * A pain in the armpits or breast that does not seem to be related to the womans menstrual period
\n * Pitting or redness of the skin of the breast; like the skin of an orange
\n * A rash around (or on) one of the nipples
\n * A swelling (lump) in one of the armpits
\n * An area of thickened tissue in a breast
\n * One of the nipples has a discharge; sometimes it may contain blood
\n * The nipple changes in appearance; it may become sunken or inverted
\n * The size or the shape of the breast changes
\n * The nipple-skin or breast-skin may have started to peel, scale or flake.\n</string>

    <string name="causes">Experts are not definitively sure what causes breast cancer. It is hard to say why one person develops the disease while another does not. We know that some risk factors can impact on a womans likelihood of developing breast cancer. These are:

        \n\n<b>Getting older</b> - the older a woman gets, the higher is her risk of developing breast cancer; age is a risk factor. Over 80 percent of all female breast cancers occur among women aged 50+ years (after the menopause).

        \n\n<b>Genetics</b> - women who have a close relative who has/had breast or ovarian cancer are more likely to develop breast cancer. If two close family members develop the disease, it does not necessarily mean they shared the genes that make them more vulnerable, because breast cancer is a relatively common cancer.

        \nThe majority of breast cancers are not hereditary.

        \nWomen who carry the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have a considerably higher risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer. These genes can be inherited. TP53, another gene, is also linked to greater breast cancer risk.

        \n\n<b>A history of breast cancer</b> - women who have had breast cancer, even non-invasive cancer, are more likely to develop the disease again, compared to women who have no history of the disease.

        \n\n<b>Having had certain types of breast lumps</b> - women who have had some types of benign (non-cancerous) breast lumps are more likely to develop cancer later on. Examples include atypical ductal hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ.

        \n\n<b>Dense breast tissue</b> - women with more dense breast tissue have a greater chance of developing breast cancer.

        \n\n<b>Estrogen exposure</b> - women who started having periods earlier or entered menopause later than usual have a higher risk of developing breast cancer. This is because their bodies have been exposed to estrogen for longer. Estrogen exposure begins when periods start, and drops dramatically during the menopause.

        \n\n<b>Obesity</b> - post-menopausal obese and overweight women may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer. Experts say that there are higher levels of estrogen in obese menopausal women, which may be the cause of the higher risk.

        \n\n<b>Height</b> - taller-than-average women have a slightly greater likelihood of developing breast cancer than shorter-than-average women. Experts are not sure why.

        \n\n<b>Alcohol consumption</b> - the more alcohol a woman regularly drinks, the higher her risk of developing breast cancer is. The Mayo Clinic says that if a woman wants to drink, she should not exceed one alcoholic beverage per day.

        \n\n<b>Radiation exposure</b> - undergoing X-rays and CT scans may raise a womans risk of developing breast cancer slightly. Scientists at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center found that women who had been treated with radiation to the chest for a childhood cancer have a higher risk of developing breast cancer.

        \n\n<b>HRT (hormone replacement therapy)</b> - both forms, combined and estrogen-only HRT therapies may increase a womans risk of developing breast cancer slightly. Combined HRT causes a higher risk.

        \n\n<b>Certain jobs</b> - French researchers found that women who worked at night prior to a first pregnancy had a higher risk of eventually developing breast cancer.

        \nCanadian researchers found that certain jobs, especially those that bring the human body into contact with possible carcinogens and endocrine disruptors are linked to a higher risk of developing breast cancer. Examples include bar/gambling, automotive plastics manufacturing, metal-working, food canning and agriculture. They reported their findings in the November 2012 issue of Environmental Health.

        \n\n<b>Cosmetic implants may undermine breast cancer survival</b> - women who have cosmetic breast implants and develop breast cancer may have a higher risk of dying prematurely form the disease compared to other females, researchers from Canada reported in the BMJ (British Medical Journal) (May 2013 issue).

        \nThe team looked at twelve peer-reviewed articles on observational studies which had been carried out in Europe, the USA and Canada.

        \nExperts had long-wondered whether cosmetic breast implants might make it harder to spot malignancy at an early stage, because they produce shadows on mammograms.

        \nIn this latest study, the authors found that a woman with a cosmetic breast implant has a 25 percent higher risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer when the disease has already advanced, compared to those with no implants.

        \nWomen with cosmetic breast implants who are diagnosed with breast cancer have a 38 percent higher risk of death from the disease, compared to other patients diagnosed with the same disease who have no implants, the researchers wrote.

        \nAfter warning that there were some limitations in the twelve studies they looked at, the authors concluded "Further investigations are warranted into the long term effects of cosmetic breast implants on the detection and prognosis of breast cancer, adjusting for potential confounders."</string>
